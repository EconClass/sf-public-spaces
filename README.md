# SF Public Spaces

A website that shows off San Francisco's public spaces. 

## TODOS

This is in progress, there is still a lot to be done. 

- Host on GitHub Pages. Using gh-pages, this is not working. It's failing at logging in on the command line. 
  - npm run deploy
  - If not working clear the cache
    - rm -rf node_modules/gh-pages/.cache
